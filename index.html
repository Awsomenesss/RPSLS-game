        Welcome to RPSLS
      </h1>
      <p class="new-game-intro">
        RPSLS is a luck game where you choose between five things: Rock, Paper,
        Scissors, Lizard, and Spock!

      </p>
      <p class="new-game-intro">Here's how it works:</p>
      <ul class="new-game-rules">
        <li>
          <strong>Rock</strong> can smash <em>Scissors</em> or <em>Lizard</em>.
          Imagine a big rock squishing scissors or a tiny lizard. That's how
          rock wins!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Paper</strong> can cover <em>Rock</em> or outsmart
          <em>Spock</em>. Picture paper hiding rock or being really clever with
          Spock. That's how paper wins!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scissors</strong> can cut <em>Paper</em> or snip
          <em>Lizard</em>. Think of scissors slicing through paper or lizard.
          That's how scissors win!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lizard</strong> can poison <em>Spock</em> or get squished by
          <em>Rock</em>. Imagine a sneaky lizard poisoning Spock or rock
          squishing it. That's how lizard wins!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spock</strong> can smash <em>Scissors</em> or vaporize
          <em>Rock</em>. See Spock using his superpowers to win against scissors
          or rocks. That's how Spock wins!
        </li>
      </ul>
